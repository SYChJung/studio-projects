			This is a graph showing Spanish monarchs, along with those of Aragon and Castile. I included Aragon and Castile on the graph, as the kingdom of Spain was founded by the union of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile.
			<br>
			The orange boxes show the lineage of Aragonese monarchs, the yellow boxes the lineage of Castilian monarchs, and turquoise boxes the lineage of Spanish monarchs.
			<br>
			Each box indicates the lifespan of the monarch, of which the darker colored section indicates the reign. If you move your mouse over the box, more information shows up: name, kingdom, house, familial relationship to a previous monarch, year of birth, year of death, start year of reign, end year of reign.
