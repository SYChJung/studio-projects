Organize the dataset
- Divide the dataset by All sectors, Industrial, Domestic, Agricultural
- Divide the dataset by BAU, optimistic, pessimistic
- show the water stress changes

"Baseline water stress measures competition for surface water, calculated as the ratio of local water withdraws over renewable supply. Projections are based on a business-as-usual scenario using SSP2 and RCP8.5."

- Rate 0-1 : low            water stress
- Rate 1-2 : low-medium     water stress
- Rate 0-1 : medium-high    water stress
- Rate 0-1 : high           water stress
- Rate 0-1 : extremely high water stress

Organize the dataset into to 12 cateria : All sectors, Industrial, Domestic, Agricultural water stresses; BAU, optimistic, pessimistic estimation

Ploted the water stress changes by each cateria.
