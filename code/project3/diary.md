Over 4,300 individuals submitted data during the first atlas yielding a final, cumulative dataset of over 361,583 records. Over 1,200 individuals submitted data for the second atlas project, resulting in a final database of 519,570 records.

Breeding_df.to_csv("Breeding_df.csv")

- made a visualizaton of number of each kind of bird with breeding behavior “Adult carrying fecal sac”
