			This is a graph showing the number of birds according to their breeding behavior and species. The size of each circle represents the number of birds in each category.
			<br>
			<br>New York Stateâ€™s breeding bird atlases record bird sightings in the state from 1980 to 1985 and from 2000 to 2005. Each record contains information about the location where the bird was sighted, the observer, the year of observation, etc. Among these, the information about the breeding behaviors and the kinds of birds interested me most.
			<br>
			<br><!--I organized the Breeding Bird Atlases dataset into a dataframe of breeding behaviors by each kind of bird. With this I used D3.js to make a graph showing the number of birds for each category. The numbers of birds is represented by the radii of the circles.
			<br>
			<br-->If you move your cursor over the circle, you can see more information: number of birds, kind of bird, bird breeding behavior.
